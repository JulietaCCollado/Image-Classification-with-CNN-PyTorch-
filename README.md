# Image-Classification-with-CNN-PyTorch-
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Built with PyTorch, the model is trained to classify images into 10 categories. The project includes scripts for training, evaluating, and predicting custom images, along with helper functions and a modular structure for easy expansion.
